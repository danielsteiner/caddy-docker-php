# caddy-docker-php
This repository contains three different Dockerfiles to build custom versions of the Caddy 2.4.2 image - one with some caddy plugins and two with php bundled with it. 
Feel free to pull the repository and use the image or pull the image via docker.

Note: The PHP7 image has not yet been updated to Caddy 2.4.2, this one is still on 2.3.0 because of some strange compatibility issues.
